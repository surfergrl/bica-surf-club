The BICA Surf Club website hosts several pages of information about the surf club based in Llangrannog, West Wales. It is bilingual in order to serve the community in which it is based.  

The club was set up in 2007, but the website is now badly out of date and the relaunch requires a new site. 

Users of the site (and members of the club) are age 8+ and have differing levels of technological know-how. Users wil include the surf club members themselves, prospective members, volunteers, sponsors, local residents and visitors. 

Aims of this website: 
•	To allow users to easily find information about what the club offers 
•	To reduce the admin burden on the club Secretary by presenting information clearly 
•	To show that the community welcomes all surfers 
•	To promote the sponsors 
•	To collect signup information for interested parties
•	To allow people to ask for more information  

I have chosen to use three different pages rather than sections on one page. This has allowed me to split the information up and organise it into more manageable sections.  

One page gives basic information on the club including sponsors. 

The Events page is organised to allow people to find suitable activities. Text appears in expandable sections with meaningful headings. 

The Sign Up page invites comments and allows users to sign up to the club. This directly meets the last two aims of the site.
